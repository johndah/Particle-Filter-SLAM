# Particle Filter SLAM

Implementation and [paper](https://github.com/johndah/Particle-Filter-SLAM/blob/master/Particle%20Filter%20SLAM%20paper%20-%20John%20Dahlberg.pdf) of Simultaneous Localization and Mapping for a point featured map simulating a robot with Lidar measurments, using a particle filter. Along the pre-determined trajectory, the point featured landmarks as well as an occupancy grid is sketched.
